# System analysis

This repository presents laboratory work on system analysis by [Vyacheslav Logvinets](https://vk.com/mr.langvest "goto vk page").

All tasks are combined into one project named ``system-analysis`` and are available separately on different pages. The project is currently available at [this link](https://sys.langvest.by).

The project uses a basic technology stack to implement the SSR concept using React. A similar concept is implemented in projects such as Facebook, Instagram and Grosser.

The latest implementation of the ECMAScript specification was used to write this project. At the semantic level, the code is written with ES6+ support, at the physical level, the code is focused on ES5 server and client parts support.
